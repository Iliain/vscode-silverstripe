# VSCODE - SilverStripe
Basically this makes .ss files look good again and adds a few snippets to .ss files and .php files that I found handy.

## Make emmet work and not feel bad

Open `Preferences` -> `Settings`

Add below settings to enable Emmet for blade:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "silverstripe": "html"
},
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
```
